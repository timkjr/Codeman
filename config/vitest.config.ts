/**
 * EVERY test in the repo, including the ones that cannot pass on an arbitrary
 * machine — `npm run test:all`. Reach for it when you want the complete picture
 * and are prepared to read past environmental failures.
 *
 * This is NOT what `npm test` runs. On a machine without chromium, a free port
 * or per-machine PNG baselines this config fails ~87 tests on a clean master,
 * which makes it useless as a pass/fail signal: the default gate is
 * config/vitest.ci.config.ts, and the suites it leaves out each have their own
 * runner (`test:browser`, `test:perf`, `test:mobile`). See config/test-suites.ts.
